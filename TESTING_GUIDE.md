## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Your Splitsy app is now fully functional! Here's how to test it:

### 1. **Access the App**
- The Expo server is running on port 8082
- Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone
- Or visit the URL: `exp://192.168.0.38:8082`

- âœ… User preferences remembered

### 3. **Test Flow Suggestions**

1. **First Time Setup**
   - Register a new account
   - Create your first group
   - Add a few sample expenses

2. **Expense Management**
   - Try different expense categories
   - Test custom split amounts
   - Add expenses with different participants

3. **Settlement Testing**
   - View your balances in the Activity tab
   - Use the settlement screen to see detailed breakdowns
   - Test payment app integrations

4. **Notification Features**
   - Check the Activity tab for notification badges
   - View recent notifications
   - Create new expenses to generate notifications

### 4. **Known Limitations**

- **Local Data Only**: Data is stored locally on your device (not synced between devices)
- **Single User Mode**: While the app supports multiple users conceptually, testing is done with one account
- **Payment Integration**: Payment apps open but actual transactions need to be completed manually
- **Real-time Sync**: No real-time updates between devices (this would require a backend server)

### 5. **Next Steps for Production**

If you want to make this a real multi-user app, you would need:
- **Backend API**: Server to handle user data and real-time sync
- **Push Notifications**: Real notifications sent to devices
- **Cloud Database**: Shared data storage (Firebase, Supabase, etc.)
- **Real Payment Integration**: Actual payment processing APIs

### 6. **Troubleshooting**

**App won't load?**
- Make sure you're on the same WiFi network as your computer
- Try refreshing the Expo Go app
- Check the terminal for any error messages

**Features not working?**
- Clear the app data by closing and reopening
- Check the console in Expo for error messages

### 7. **Code Structure**

Your app now includes:
- `App.js` - Main application with navigation and UI
- `context/UserContext.js` - User authentication and management
- `context/DataContext.js` - Groups and transactions data
- `context/NotificationContext.js` - Notification system
- `context/ToastContext.js` - Toast notification system
- `screens/AuthScreen.js` - Login/registration
- `screens/ProfileScreen.js` - User profile management
- `screens/SettlementScreen.js` - Advanced debt settlement
- `components/EnhancedExpenseForm.js` - Multi-step expense creation
- `components/Toast.js` - Animated toast component
